Equipment Management System - Main Application Entry Point

This module serves as the primary entry point for the Equipment Management System.
It handles essential startup tasks including:
1. Database initialization
2. GUI system setup
3. Main window creation
4. Application event loop

Application Components:
- Database Setup:
  * Student records
  * Uniform inventory
  * Instrument tracking
  * Component relationships

- User Interface:
  * Main window initialization
  * Event system configuration
  * Widget hierarchy setup
  * Visual presentation

Dependencies:
- PyQt6: GUI framework and event system
- Local modules:
  * ui.py: Main interface implementation
  * db.py: Database operations and schema
  
Execution Flow:
1. Verify/create database tables
2. Initialize Qt application
3. Create main window
4. Enter event processing loop

Note:
    This module should be run directly as a script,
    not imported as a module in other components.

    Main application execution block.
    
    This section implements the core application startup sequence:
    1. Database Schema Initialization:
       - Student records table
       - Uniform inventory tables
       - Instrument tracking table
       - Component relationship tables
    
    2. GUI System Initialization:
       - Qt application context
       - Main window creation
       - Window display
       - Event loop start
    
    Database Setup Steps:
    1. Create student management tables
    2. Initialize uniform tracking system
    3. Set up instrument inventory
    4. Establish component relationships
    
    GUI Launch Sequence:
    1. Initialize Qt framework
    2. Create main application window
    3. Display interface
    4. Begin event processing
    
    Error Handling:
    - Database creation failures
    - GUI initialization issues
    - Resource allocation problems
    
    Note:
        All database tables must be successfully created
        before the GUI system is initialized
